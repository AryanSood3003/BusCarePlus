## Features
Our project implements four sensors (Co2 sensor, Temperature, Ultrasonic and Accelerometer). 
The sensors send data to raspberry pi which send it to the app via Firebase. 
The app displays the data in 2 separate tabs, Safety and Maintenance. 
The safety tab displays the Bus speed and the passenger count. 
The Maintenance tab lets the user know if the HVAC systems are functioning normally. 
If there is any issue the user gets sent a notification via the app and he/she can take appropriate action.
